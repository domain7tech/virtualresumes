  <h2>Cover Letter Statement</h2>
  <p>I’m writing to express my interest in the Director of Information Security role. With over two decades of experience spanning infrastructure leadership, secure system design, and AI-driven transformation across five countries, I bring a strategic and technical approach to modern cybersecurity challenges—especially as organizations expand into customer-facing digital models.</p>

  <p>I am a CISSP-certified executive who has led security planning and governance for complex environments—from a 30-acre U.S. campus to $130M international projects. My work has focused on integrating GRC frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001), managing full lifecycle migrations, and embedding secure automation practices. Most recently, I’ve developed the SAFIRE Framework (Strategic AI Framework for Intelligent & Responsive Engagement), which empowers organizations to integrate AI while remaining compliant, efficient, and ethically grounded.</p>

  <p>Beyond strategy, I’m deeply technical. I’ve consulted for government and private clients, building database and API infrastructure, migrating legacy systems, profiling hardened Linux environments, and even uncovering confirmed vulnerabilities in major platforms like Google. I actively apply DevSecOps practices using PostgreSQL, Oracle, Python, and container-based cloud systems (GCP, AWS).</p>

  <p>I’m particularly interested in this opportunity because it aligns with my passion for building scalable, secure systems that support growth without sacrificing trust. I’m confident I can help define the future-state security vision your client needs—while managing the present risks with clarity and confidence.</p>

  <p><strong>Warm regards,</strong><br/>Anthony De Prato</p>
